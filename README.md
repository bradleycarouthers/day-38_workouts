# day-38_workouts
Day 38 of 100

This program asks the user pertinent information and what workouts were done during the current day, and the user can quite plainly type out the answer. Then while considering previous input data, it creates rows on a spreadsheet.

This spreadsheet details how long in minutes (on avg) it should have taken them and how many calories were likely burned. There are also the date and time stamps. Two APIs were used, sheety and nutritionix. This doesn't consider outside variables though like steep inclines if one went cycling or running, for instance.
